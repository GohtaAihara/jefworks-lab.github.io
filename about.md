I am currently an NCI F99/K00 post-doctoral fellow in the lab of [Dr. Xiaowei Zhuang](http://zhuang.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I received my PhD in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics at Harvard under the mentorship of [Dr. Peter Kharchenko](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/) at the Department of Biomedical Informatics and in close collaboration with [Dr. Catherine Wu](http://wulab.dfci.harvard.edu/) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. My research interests center around developing computational methods for identifying and characterizing heterogeneity at the single cell level, particularly in the context of cancer, using multi-omics approaches.
