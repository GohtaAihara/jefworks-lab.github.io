We are always looking for highly motivated and independent post-docs interested in furthering their careers in academia as well as developing new skills for transition into industry. If you are interested in a post-doc position, please follow this guide:
	
1. Email Prof. Fan with the subject line “Post-doc Application: [your name]”. Include in the body of the email: 
- A few sentences about who you are, where you are currently studying / what you are currently working on, and why you are interested in this lab. This serves as your ‘cover letter.’
- A copy of your CV
- The following filled out [Individual Development Plan (IDP) interview form](/assets/docs/interview_form.docx) (optional)
- Contact information (both email and phone number) for 2 to 4 references  
If Prof. Fan does not respond within a week, candidates are highly encouraged to followup and email again.
<br><br>  
2. If we like your application, we will set up a time for a video conference call. This will take 30 minutes to an hour. At this stage, Prof. Fan will also reach out directly to your references.

3. If we think you may be a good fit, we will invite you out for an on-site interview. The on-site interview will likely take up an entire day. It will involve an hour presentation in addition to one-on-one discussions with Prof. Fan as well as others in the department, including faculty, post-docs, as well as graduate students and even undergraduate students. The purpose of this visit is to assess fit. Not every post-doc, no matter how talented, will be the best fit in every lab. You should also take this visit as an opportunity to assess whether you will be able to be happy and productive in this lab for the next few years of your life. 

4. After your on-site interview, Prof. Fan will solicit feedback from everyone you spoke with. She will then reach out with an offer or encourage you to keep looking. We will work with you to discuss the terms of your hire, including salary, benefits, professional development opportunities, and anything else you may need to be successful here and through your career trajectory. 

Successful computational post-doc applicants will have:
- a PhD in a biological, computational, or statistics-related field
- Fluency in at least one of the following programming languages: R, Python, C++, Javascript
- At least two first author or co-first author papers with submitted, accepted, or published status in peer-reviewed journals
- Created least one open-source software package or resource
