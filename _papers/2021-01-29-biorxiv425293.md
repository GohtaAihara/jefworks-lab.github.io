abstract: RNA velocity analysis can predict cell state changes from single cell transcriptomics data. To interpret these cell state changes as part of underlying cellular trajectories, current approaches rely on visualization with 2D embeddings derived from principal components, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, among others. However, these 2D embeddings can yield different representations of the underlying trajectories, hindering the interpretation of cell state changes. To address this challenge, we developed VeloViz to create RNA-velocity-informed 2D embeddings. We show that by taking into consideration the predicted future transcriptional states from RNA velocity analysis, VeloViz can help ensure a more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories.
