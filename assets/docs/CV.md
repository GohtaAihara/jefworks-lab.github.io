## RESEARCH INTERESTS	

My research strives to develop a comprehensive understanding of key genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional programs controlling cellular development, differentiation, and maturation using high-throughput single-cell multi-omics approaches. I am particularly interested in developmental trajectories in the context of pediatric cancers and how disruptions to normal developmental trajectories drive tumor formation and progression to ultimately shape clinical outcomes. I develop new open-source computational software for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data that can be tailored and applied to diverse cancer types and biological systems.
