# Overview
We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure everyone has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience, both professionally and personally. Accordingly, all JEFworks lab members are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times. We create our culture and our culture is inclusive.

Please note that this code of conduct supplements, and does not trump, Department and University level policies for your level of employ or study.

# Inclusion and diversity
We value an inclusive and diverse research environment to support each individuals development and research, and to promote robust decision making and high quality research. All group members are thus dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and/or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our group in any form and we also all members to support each other in upholding the following principals:

- All communication, be it online or in person, should be appropriate for a professional audience, and be considerate of people from different cultural backgrounds.  
- Be kind to others, and do not insult or put down other group members. We acknowledge that we will grow as a team, and learn from each other.  
- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.  
- Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Prof. Fan will discuss the code of conduct with lab members who violate these rules. If inappropriate behaviour persists after this initial discussion, formal processes, in line with Johns Hokins University’s work practice policies, will commence.

# Flexible working hours 
The exact hours members of the lab choose to work is up to them. We believe in each lab member's ability to best manage their own schedules in a manner that enables them to efficiently and effectively meet their research goals and advance their careers. However, being on campus between 9:00am and 5:00pm most days will help facilitate collaborative working and lead to a more fulfilling research experience. 

We do expect all lab members to attend and contribute to group meeting and journal club discussions if they are not otherwise engaged in research business (e.g. at conference, attending training or a lecture, or using a core facility). 

Please inform Prof. Fan of holidays or notable absences in advance by marking on the group calendar. Permission for holiday is rarely required, but please respect key deadlines within the calendar year and respect that we work as a research team. It is important to take holidays, respect weekends (or time in lieu) and establish a sustainable work-life balance. But it is also important to respect the time and efforts of others, including collaborators, publishing editors, funders, and so forth, and to note that effective working will improve the quality of your research and career potential. If you struggle with establishing a sustainable work life balance, please discuss this with Prof. Fan at an early stage.

# Lab communication

We strive to respect the ability of fellow lab members to engage in distraction-free deep thinking and long periods of uninterrupted work. 

For all communication methods, please respect people’s working patterns, and remember that other people will have different priorities and focus. Please give consideration to the timing of your correspondence with respect to what the recipient needs to do. No lab members are required nor should feel obliged to reply to messages outside of their typical work hours. 

Seeking out in-person discussions is strongly encouraged for urgent matters requiring immediate attention.

If you experience any challenges related to communication within the lab, please do not hesitate to contact Prof. Fan.

# Remember: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"

Thanks for being a part of the team!
