# NIH F99/K00 Grant Tips, Example, and Personal Experience

In 2017, I applied for and received an NIH Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award (F99/K00) from the NCI. I was a 4th year PhD student at the time. I transitioned to the K00 component approximately a year later. I’ve included my F99/K00 grant and full summary statements as an example for those currently applying. Enjoy and good luck!

## Introduction

The NIH Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow Transition Award (F99/K00) is (according to the [RFA](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-19-002.html)) intended to encourage and retain outstanding graduate students and facilitate the transition into research postdoctoral appointments. Frankly, I don't think most graduate student need help transitioning into a post-doc. What students, including myself, do need, and what I think this grant provides, is experience in preparing a grant, and a stepping stone to getting the bigger grant(the K99/R00), which is then a stepping stone to getting the even bigger grant (the R01). Getting my F99/K00 definitely encouraged me to stay in academia by helping me develop a concrete plan, vision, and path moving forward in academia, especially at a time when I was being presented with many other financially attractive offers from industry biotechs and startups. 

### So why apply?

1. Applying to and receiving the F99/K00 convinced my PhD advisor that I was ready to graduate: "I have a grant and I've figured out what I want to do next. You gotta let me go!"
2. Having a F99/K00 meant I was able to walk into any post-doc position because I had my own funding. Having my own funding provided me with the leverage (and the confidence!) to negotiate things from salary, to equipment, to travel.
3. ["Because getting this grant will help you get the next one."](https://jef.works/blog/2017/10/19/NIH-F-series-grant-tips-and-example/) Getting started in grant writing early, especially as a trainee, will help you develop the skills and confidence to apply to larger grants later on as an independent PI. 

### Why I am sharing my grants (and why you should too contribute to [Open Grants](https://www.ogrants.org/))

Writing a grant is a daunting task. Having examples gives you a sense of what to expect. My hope is that by sharing our grants as examples, we can help reduce some of the anxieties and barriers to entry into grant writing, and ultimately help bridge the [funding gap in science](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30950-4/fulltext).

## Getting your institutional nomination letter

Unlike other NIH F-series grants, the F99/K00 grant requires an institutional nomination letter. Only 1 nominee per institution is allowed. I actually learned of the F99/K00 grant through my PhD program and department's solicitation announcement for nominees. If your institution has a search, you will need to apply (application requirements will likely be specific to department and institution) and if you are chosen, you can then move on and submit the entire F99/K00 grant with the help of grant administrators from your institution. 

## My F99/K00 grant as an example

The F99/K00 grant application and process is very very very similar to the [F31](https://jef.works/blog/2017/10/19/NIH-F-series-grant-tips-and-example/). The only real difference is in the Specific Aims, which must be organized as:  
- Aim 1: The Dissertation Research Project: progress thus far  
- Aim 2: The Dissertation Research Project: work to be  
- Aim 3: The Postdoctoral Research Direction  

I was able to apply many of the lessons I learned from my F31 (like choosing a good co-sponsor!) in my F99 so take a look at the [notes from my F31 as well](https://jef.works/blog/2017/10/19/NIH-F-series-grant-tips-and-example/).

## Transitioning into the K00

4 months before you're ready to graduate with your PhD, you should get in touch with your program officer to discuss transitioning into your K00. This transition will require what is essentially an entirely new grant! As such, it will require an entire new set of documents more or less identical in composition to the documents from the F99 checklist (ie. a new Facilities & Resources, Equipment, etc). You do not need a new set of letters of reference though (as of 2018). 

Transitioning into the K00 was very challenging for me. The science was the easy part. But it took me a lot longer than I expected to get all the other supporting documents. Unlike with my previous grants, where I had amazing institutional administrative support and multiple sample grants from my PhD advisor to reference for documents like Facilities & Resources, I suddenly had no reference. Since I was moving to a new institution, how was I supposed to know what the resources were available to me? My new institution was unaware of this award and I had substantial difficulty acquiring an institutional letter of support. I didn't even know who to ask. Is it my new advisor? No. Apparently it's the dean of the department. The K00 transition also introduced a budget and a budget justification. What is a fringe benefit rate? Or an indirect cost? Who sets these numbers? I'm still not entirely sure. So unfortunately, this document will be extra-ordinarily difficult to fill out on your own without administrative support from a budget office. Find yours. I basically had to write a lot of emails and knock on a lot of doors (or cold call) when my emails were ignored. If you find yourself later in a similar situation, remember to assert yourself. Don't worry. It's ok. Just. Get. It. Done. 

The review process for the K00 transition however will be very different from the F99. There are no summary statements or even submission portals (as of 2018). My administrative officer simply emailed my program officer the compiled K00 grant application as a PDF, and that was it. My program officer actually asked for multiple revisions (to help ensure that the transition would be approved) before she sent it off to the K00 transition committee review board for approval. 

## Other notes

I received my PhD before I was able to transition into my K00. This is typical and the F99/K00 allows you to stay up to 6 months at your PhD institution with funding provided through your F99 before transitioning to a new institution with your K00. Your PhD institution may not be aware of this though! Because I had graduated, my PhD institution was technically no longer required to administer the remainder of my F99 grant. My PhD institution was also technically no longer required to provide me with healthcare, as I was no longer a PhD student. Yet, I couldn't be hired on as a post-doc at my PhD institution because doing so would invalidate my transition into a K00. What a bureaucratic nightmare! Luckily, my program officer was able to schedule a call with all my PhD institution's admins and straighten everything out so I could get paid and have healthcare! So the lesson is, when in doubt, talk to your program officer!
