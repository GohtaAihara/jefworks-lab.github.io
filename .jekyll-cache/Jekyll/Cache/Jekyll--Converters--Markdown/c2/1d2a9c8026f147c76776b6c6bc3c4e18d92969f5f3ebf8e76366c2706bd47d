I"C<p>I recently got my first R package on CRAN! For those who donâ€™t know, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</a> is the main repository for R packages. The packages on CRAN are the ones available to install via <code class="highlighter-rouge">install.packages</code> in R.</p>
