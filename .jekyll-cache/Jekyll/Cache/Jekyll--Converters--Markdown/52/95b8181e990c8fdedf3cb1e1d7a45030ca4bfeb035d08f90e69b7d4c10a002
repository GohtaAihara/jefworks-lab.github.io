I"T<p>Over a billion people worldwide purchase goods online. Global e-retail sales are in the trillions of dollars. So given all this interest in online shopping, you’d think that it would be easier - specifically, easier to browse. I find browsing in online shopping very limited. Particularly when it comes to sorting or filtering products. Have you ever noticed when shopping online how you can sort by ‘customer rating’ or by ‘prices: low to high’ but NOT by best bargain? By best bargain, I mean the largest monetary differential between the retail cost and the selling price. If the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2013/09/27/a-strategic-mistake-that-haunts-j-c-penney/#2f1cb698134c">failure of JCPenney’s ‘everyday low prices’ experiment</a> has taught us anything, is that people love a good deal; they love buying that supposedly $1000 jacket on sale for $500 (that’s 50% off) or that $100 shirt in the clearance bin for $10 (that’s 90% off). So it seems like being able to sort by best bargain would be a useful feature. And yet I have never seen an online shopping retailer with this sorting feature available. So since this sorting feature doesn’t exist, we as savvy programmers must take it upon ourselves to enhance our own online shopping experience and improve the efficiency of our bargain hunting!</p>
